                    <h2>Most frequent questions</h2>
                    <h3> How many air changes do I require?</h3>

                    <p> Faqs For schools - the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have released guidance - "target highest achievable air change rate for units that will not generate excessive noise or negatively impact space air distribution". A minimum number of air changes should be 3, achieving 6 is optimum.<br />

                        Association for Respiratory Technology and Physiology (ARTP) Guidelines for Lung Function Testing have released guidance. Spirometry, mouth pressures, and lung volume assessments should be conducted in rooms with over 6 air changes per hour. This would enable one patient to be assessed each hour. Rooms with few air changes can be used if left fallow overnight and cleaned the next morning. If over 10 air changes per hour can be achieved, the fallow period between patients can be 30 minutes or less.<br />

                        For dentists, current guidance from Public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_purifier">Health</a> England (PHE) and advice from the New and Emergency Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) allows a reduced fallow period in a treatment room with 10 ACH.<br />

                    <h3> What is a HEPA filter?</h3>

                    <p> HEPA stands for High-Efficiency Particular Absorbing filter. HEPA filter traps 99.97% of particulates. HEPA filters trap air contaminants in a complex web of fibers. Depending on the size of the particle, this can happen in four different ways: Inertial impaction, Diffusion, Interception, or Sieving<br />

                    <h3> What type of stuff will Mars remove from the air?</h3>

                    <p> Mars Purifier Technology can filter and kill particles of up to 0.1 microns, including COVID-19. Particles that can be removed are bacteria, viruses, fungi, volatile organic compounds, mold spores, tobacco smoke, pollen, etc<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> What maintenance is required?</h3>

                    <p> The standard time for replacement is 6-12 months.<br />

                        To maintain the ultimate performance of these purifiers, it is important to replace the filter at the right time. The change indicator light is displayed on the air purifier when the filter needs to be replaced. Recommended filter change: 6 months (4,380 hours) when used 24 hours a day<br />

                        The replacement time will vary according to the method of use and the location where the product is set. When used in places with heavy air pollution, the replacement time will be sooner<br />

                        Where should I position my air purifiers?<br />

                        It is important to position the purifier at least a minimum of 20cm from any wall. This will enable the purifier to capture air from all directions.<br />

                    <h3> How quickly can you deliver?</h3>

                    <p> Mars Purifier has a white-glove service. Our purifiers can be delivered and installed on the same day of order. The standard delivery time is between 3-5 working days.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> Does the Mars Purifier cover large spaces?</h3>

                    <p> Mars Purifiers are individually tested, certified to ISO 14644, and guaranteed to perform as promised. Our Generation Z has a clean air delivery rate of 1156m3/hr; this means it can cover areas of up to 110m2/ 1237 sqft.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> How loud is a Mars Purifier?</h3>

                    <p> The purifier is less than 20dB when working at speed setting 1. This means the purifier will not be heard. When there is pollution in the air, the purifier will work at its optimum speed to clean the air and it can reach noise levels of 58dB<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> Can I use my purifier with a humidifier?</h3>

                    <p> The purifier and humidifier can be used in conjunction. However, in places of high humidity, there is a limitation to the device. On some occasions, a humidifier can release unclean particles, which the purifier will detect. Opening a window can remove unwanted particles in the air.<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> Does UV-C light create ozone?</h3>

                    <p> No, UV-C light does not produce ozone. However, the shorter Ultraviolet-V (UV-V at 185 nanometers) wavelength of UVV light actually generates ozone. This occurs because UVV light reacts with oxygen to break it into atomic oxygen, a highly unstable atom that combines with oxygen to form O3 (Ozone).<br />
                    </p>
                    <p> Ironically, UV light in the 240-315nm wavelength will break this third oxygen atom attachment above and convert it back to oxygen. The peak ozone destruction occurs at the 254nm wavelength. So, a UV-C lamp at the 253.7nm wavelength will actually destroy Ozone!<br />
                    </p>
                    <h3> What is the role of anions/ ionizers?</h3>

                    <p> Air ionizers rely on the chemical properties of ions. An ion is a negatively or positively charged particle. Air ionizers make the air in a room healthier for people to breathe, especially for people suffering from allergies, asthma, and other respiratory-related ailments.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p> Air ionizers create negative ions using electricity and then discharge them into the air. These negative ions attach to positively charged particles in the room, such as dust, bacteria, pollen, smoke, and other allergens. The positively charged particles and negative ions bond together to create dense dirt particles that cannot float in the air. These heavier dirt particles fall to the ground and wait to be swept up at a later time. Some particles might fall onto other surfaces in the room, such as television screens, computers, countertops, and sofas. Homeowners can easily clean these surfaces by dusting or wiping them off with a rag.<br />

                    <h3> How Mars Purifier calculates the coverage (m3) of our machines?</h3>

                    <p>IAQ researchers have found that the minimum ventilation recommendation is three ACH, and the more ventilation or air changes you can achieve in a room further enhances the indoor air quality. This means higher ACH values correspond to better ventilation. Mars Purifier Calculates the coverage of the machines by ensuring 5 Air Changes are achieved in that given coverage, exceeding the minimum recommendation by nearly two full ACH. Validated by ISO 14644 for airflow rates<br />

                    <h3>What are indoor air quality and PM 2.5?</h3>

                    <p>Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) refers to the air quality within and around buildings, especially as it relates to the health of the building's occupants. Removing common pollutants indoors can help reduce your risk of indoor health concerns. Particles that can impact Indoor Air Quality include common smoke, bacteria, tobacco smoke, pollen, pet dander, and dust. Particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and one-half microns or less in width. The Indoor Air Hygiene Institute requires a PM2.5 level of 12 μg/m3 or less, with infrequent or no spikes of 35 μg/m3 or higher.</p>
